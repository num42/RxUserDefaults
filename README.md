Overview
-------
Reactive UserDefaults, inspired by [rx-preferences].

Typehandling was inspired by [wrap] and [unbox]


## Usage

To create a setting use the constructor of that class:
```swift
let settings = RxSettings(userDefaults: userDefaults)
let setting = settings.setting(key: "INSERT_KEY", defaultValue: "DEFAULT")
```
The arguments should be self explanatory.

Currently only following Types are supported:
- String
- Int
- Bool
- Array (only with the types supported by the UserDefaults)
- Enum (but enum must conform to the RxSettingEnum protocol)

Functions you can use:
```swift
// gets the value
let val = setting.value

// sets the value
setting.value = val

// check if value is saved (note: the default value is not automatically saved)
setting.isSet

// deletes the value
setting.remove()

// provides a hot observable that triggers on every change
// and starts with the current value (or default value)
setting.asObservable()

```

## Storage Layer
If you do not want to use the UserDefaults as a storage layer you can implement your own.
To do this you have to confirm to the StorageLayer Protocol.

## Warnings & TODOs
I want to support everything that the UserDefaults support (e.g. Dictionary, URL ...).
For now you can expand the library to more types by conforming to the RxSettingCompatible protocol.
But note that persisting types that are not supported by the UserDefaults will fail silently.

## Installation


RxUserDefaults is available through SPM
